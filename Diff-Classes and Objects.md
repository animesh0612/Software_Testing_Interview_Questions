### Difference between classes and objects?

### Class: The Blueprint

Think of a class as a blueprint for a house. When an architect creates a blueprint, they are designing what the house will look like, including details like the number of rooms, the layout, and other features. However, the blueprint itself is not a house; it's just a plan for building one.

### Object: The Actual House

An object is like the actual house built from the blueprint. When construction workers follow the blueprint and build a house, that house is the physical realization of the blueprint's plan. You can have many houses (objects) built from the same blueprint (class), and each house will have its own unique address and possibly different features (like paint color) while still following the same overall design.

### More Examples

- **Class**: A recipe for a cake. It describes the ingredients and steps needed to bake the cake but is not the cake itself.
- **Object**: The cake you bake using the recipe. You can bake multiple cakes using the same recipe, and each cake is an object.

### Key Points

- **Class**: Defines the structure and behavior. It's a template or blueprint.
  - Example in code: `class Car { String color; String model; void drive() { ... } }`
- **Object**: An instance of the class. It's the actual item created based on the class.
  - Example in code: `Car myCar = new Car(); myCar.color = "Red"; myCar.model = "Toyota";`

In summary, a class is a plan or template, while an object is a specific instance of that plan.
